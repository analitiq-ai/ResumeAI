# ResumeAI

ResumeAI is a job application tool for lazy people. 

ResumeAI will take your current resume and use it to create a tailored resume and cover letter for a job you want to apply for using Large Language Models (LLMs). And it will do that for 000s of jobs of your preference while you sleep. 

It works as a wrapper for [rendercv](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv), enhancing its capabilities with AI-powered resume creation.

You can see right away that a **tailored resume** give you better chance to get the job:
