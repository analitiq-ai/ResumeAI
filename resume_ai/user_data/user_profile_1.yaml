job_requirements:
    - "I seek a position of supreme authority within a well-structured, hierarchical organization—preferably one with an empire-spanning presence and an unquestioning workforce. Ideally, this role would grant me full executive control, allowing me to make “persuasive” managerial decisions without the need for excessive bureaucracy (or HR interference)."
    - "Working hours should be flexible but lean towards the late-night shift, as I prefer to operate under the cover of darkness. However, I am always available for emergency Force-related interventions, planetary negotiations (via orbital bombardment), and disciplinary actions. Overtime is expected but should be compensated with either direct power or complete submission of the workforce."
    - "I seek a full-time position—none of this “part-time Sith” nonsense. Commitment is key. I expect at least three weeks of paid leave (to meditate in my personal bacta tank) and Sith-mas bonuses in the form of additional star systems under my control."
    - "Compensation is negotiable but should include a personal capital ship, unlimited use of company stormtroopers, and a fully operational battle station. Health insurance should cover cybernetic maintenance and respiratory support."
    - "An ideal workplace culture would discourage insubordination, foster loyalty through fear, and allow me to wear my cape without judgment. Remote work is acceptable if the company provides a personal meditation chamber and hologram conferencing."
    - "To summarize, I desire absolute power, a structured work environment, and a well-resourced empire at my disposal. Also, no sand. Ever."
